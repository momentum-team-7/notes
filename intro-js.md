# Introduction to Programming with JavaScript

---

## What is a programming language

### (and why do we need so many of them)?

- Programming languages are written for humans
- They provide us with a mental model of the computer and a vocabulary
- Different models and vocabularies make sense for different applications

---

## What's JavaScript good for?

- JavaScript is a general-purpose programming language.
- It is loaded with html and css onto a page and run by the browser.
- It is the universal language for creating interactive web pages.

---

## Where does JavaScript come from?

- It was designed by Brendan Eich in 1995 as a scripting language for Netscape Navigator (the predecessor to Firefox)
- Eich designed it in two weeks, drawing inspiration from languages both popular and obscure
- Because it powers the web, it has had an interesting trajectory

---

## the `<script>` element

### What do you expect the purpose of this element is?

```html
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <script src="main.js"></script>
  <title>Facts About Bears</title>
</head>
```

---

## Let's write some JavaScript

1. Create a folder and put a new basic html file in it. Make sure to include `DOCTYPE` and all the standard parts of any html page. It does not need to have any `body` content.
2. Create a file called `main.js`.
3. In that file, type the following line, and be sure to save the file:
   `console.log("Hello, World!")`
<<<<<<< HEAD
4. Link your JS file to your html page: put a `script` tag with a `src` attribute that links to your javascript file in the <head> element in your html document:
=======
4. Link your JS file to your html page: put a `script` tag with a `src` attribute that links to your javascript file in the `<head>` element in your html document:
>>>>>>> c507c900e7e60fb0bc587fd133b7e833e9faf849
   `<script src="main.js"></script>`
5. Load the html page in the browser.
6. Open the javascript console in the developer tools. You should see `Hello, World!` printed there.

---

## Printing output with the console

```js
console.log('My name is', name)
```

---

## Parts of almost every language

- Data types
- Variables
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Functions

---

## What is a data type?

The way that a programming language expresses values.

For instance, think about how you place an order at a restaurant. How do you express the answer to each of these questions?

- How many eggs do you want? (2)
- How do you want them cooked? ('Sunny side up')
- Do you want a cup of coffee? (yes)

---

## Data types in JavaScript

- **String** `"hello there!"`, `'hello there!'`
- **Number** `1`, `200`, `3.14159`
- **Boolean** `true`, `false`
- **Undefined** `undefined` (has no value assigned)
- **Null** `null` (has a value of nothing)

---

## Numbers

- These are what you expect, for when you need to do math
- Can do math with `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, and `**`
- Can compare with `===`, `!==`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, and `<=`

---

## Math operators

- `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
  add, subtract, multiply, divide

- `%` **modulo**
  The remainder of division.For example, `9 % 2` equals `1`

- `**` **power**
  Raise x to the power of y. For example, `2 ** 3` equals `8`

---

## Strings

For when you need to represent characters/letters, words, sentences,

- "I have 5 pets"
- "0"
- ""
- "^&#O%@"
- "919-439-0215"

---

## Comments in JavaScript

```js
let something = 'This is just to have some valid JavaScript code here'
// single line comments in JS
/* a multi-line comment
looks like this */
let anotherThing = 'More random stuff just as a placeholder'
```

---

## Variables

- Variables are a name given to a value
- One way to think of them is a box that holds a value
- Declare them with the keyword `const` or `let`
- Variables delared with `let` can have a new value reassigned
- You don't need to use the keyword `let` again when you reassign a value.

---

## Variable keywords and assignment

```js
// variables declared with const cannot be reassigned
const width = 300
width = 400 // NOPE! You can't do this; you will get an error
const name = 'Dorian'

// variables declared with let can be reassigned
let points = 12
let paused = false
paused = true
points = 13
```

---

## The difference between declaring and setting variables

```js
// here we declare and assign an initial value in one line
//this is also called initialization
let totalCost = 99.99

// We could also have done it in two steps:
let totalCost
totalCost = 99.99
```

---

## Shortcut assignment

`=` is used to assign values to variables. There are shortcuts for using math and updating variables, though.

```js
points += 5 // same as points = points + 5
points *= 2 // same as points = points * 2
points++ // same as points = points + 1
```

---

## Write some JavaScript 2

1. Clone the following repo:
<<<<<<< HEAD
   `https://github.com/momentum-team-5/in-class-js-hello-world`
=======
   `https://github.com/momentum-team-7/examples/tree/main/js-hello-world-exercise`
>>>>>>> c507c900e7e60fb0bc587fd133b7e833e9faf849
2. Open the repo in VS Code. You'll be working on the exercises in `main.js`.
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.
4. In the browser, open the dev tools and go to the JavaScript console by clicking on the "Console" tab.
5. Work on exercises 1-8. Uncomment the necessary lines in each exercise as you work on it. When you make a change in the javascript file, save it and then reload the index.html page in the browser. You should see the `console.log()` output in the console.

---

## Expressions and statements in JavaScript

In a computer language, a group of words, numbers, and operators that performs a specific task is a **statement**. We say a statement is "run" or "executed".

`a = b * 2`

- `a` and `b` are variables. They will be _evaluated_.
- `2` is a value
- `*` and `=` are operators
- `b * 2` is an expression that will be _evaluated_.

**Expressions** are individual parts of a statement that are evaluated to produce a value.
Statements are executed to make something happen.

---

## Programming in JavaScript

- JavaScript programs are simply a sequence of statements to execute.
- The JavaScript interpreter (in the browser) executes these statements one after another in the order they are written.
- Another way to “make something happen” is to alter this default order of execution, and JavaScript has a number of statements or control structures that do just this:
  - conditionals, loops, and jumps (stop or go back to where you were)

---

## Conditionals

<<<<<<< HEAD
One of the most basic things we need to do in programming is say "if this thing is true, then do this other thing."

We use **if/else** statements for this.
=======
One of the most basic things we need to do in programming is say "if this thing is true, then do this. (And if it's not true, then don't do it.)"

Sometimes we also want to say "And if it's not true, then do that."


We use **if** and **if/else** statements for this.
>>>>>>> c507c900e7e60fb0bc587fd133b7e833e9faf849

---

## `if` can be used by itself

```js
if (points > 10) {
  console.log('You win')
}

if (madeGoal) {
  points = points + 2
  console.log('You made a goal!')
  madeGoal = false
}
```

---

## `if/else`

```js
if (points > 10) {
  console.log('You win')
} else {
  console.log('You lose')
}
```

```js
if (predicate) {
  codeBlock
} else {
  otherCodeBlock
}
```

---

## `if...else if..else`

```js
if (yourPoints > theirPoints) {
  console.log('You win')
} else if (theirPoints > yourPoints) {
  console.log('You lose')
} else {
  console.log('You tied')
}
```

---

## Comparison operators

- `===` - equality
- `!==` - inequality
- `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=` - gt, gte, lt, lte

---

## ⚠️ Note that `=` is not for comparison!

### `=` is the _assignment_ operator

```js
a = b //assigns the value of b to a
a === b // compares to see if a is equal to and the same type as b
```

---

## Truthy and Falsy

Every value can _act_ like a boolean. When a value is treated like a boolean, we say that it is either **truthy** or **falsy**.

A single expression or value can be used in a conditional:

```js
if (value) {
  // do something, because the value is truthy
} else {
  // don't, because the value is falsy
}
```

[JS Equality Table](https://dorey.github.io/JavaScript-Equality-Table/)

---

## Falsy values in JS

- `0`
- `-0`
- `""` (an empty string)
- `null`
- `undefined`
- `NaN`
- `false`

---

## Truthy values in JS

Everything that is not on the falsy list is truthy. That includes:

- "any characters in a string"
- "0"
- "false"
- `true`
- `{}` (an empty object)
- `[]` (an empty array)
- any Number or negative Number

---

## _Anything_ that evaluates to true or false can be used in an if statement.

⚠️ You can always check conditions in the console

```js
if (32) {
  console.log('This is true!')
}
```

---

## Logical operators

### These let us combine conditions

`&&` and
`||` or
`!` not

```js
let a = true
let b = false

a && b // a AND b have to be true for this expression to evaluate as true
a || b // a OR b have to be true for this expression to evaluate as true
!a // "not a": if a is true, then this will evaluate to false
!b // "not b": if b is false, then this will evaluate to true
```

---

## while and for loops

The next basic thing we need to do in programming is repeat the same task over and over.

`while` and `for` are our tools for this.

---

## while loop

```js
// say hi 5 times
let count = 0
while (count < 5) {
  console.log('Hi!')
  count += 1
}
```

---

## while loop

A while loop will run its code block as long as its predicate is true.

```js
while (predicate) {
  codeBlock
}
```

---

## for loop

```js
// say hi 5 times
for (let count = 0; count < 5; count++) {
  console.log('Hi!')
}
```

---

## for loops

A for loop combines its setup, predicate, and updating in one statement. It will run its code block as long as its predicate is true.

```js
for (setup; predicate; update) {
  codeBlock
}
```

---

## When do I use a while loop vs a for loop?

- A for loop is for when you need to go through a limited list of numbers, always increasing (or decreasing) by the same amount, and ending at a specified point.
- A while loop is for everything else.
- You might think you'd use more while loops than for loops, but that's not usually the case.

---

## While loop example

### Finding the first 10 prime numbers

```js
let primeCount = 0
let currentNumber = 1

while (primeCount < 10) {
  if (isPrime(currentNumber)) {
    console.log(currentNumber, 'is prime')
    primeCount += 1
  }
  currentNumber += 1
}
```

Note: this depends on a function named isPrime() that we don't have defined here.

---

## For loop example

### FizzBuzz

```js
for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
  if (i % 3 === 0) {
    console.log(' Fizz')
  } else if (i % 5 === 0) {
    console.log(' Buzz')
  } else {
    console.log(i)
  }
}
```

---

## What is a function?

A function is a block of code that takes zero or more values and returns one value.

This block of code isn't executed immediately, but later when it is _called_.

---

## Think about a recipe - black beans and rice

1. **Chop** an _onion_.
2. **Mince** _two cloves of garlic_.
3. **Heat** _1 teaspoon olive oil_ in a _stockpot_ over _medium-high heat_.
4. **Add** the _onion_ and _garlic_ and **saute** for _4 minutes_.
5. **Add** the _rice_ and **saute** for _2 minutes_.
6. **Add** _1.5 cups of vegetable broth_ and **boil** _the mixture_.
7. **Lower the heat** and **cook** for _20 minutes_.
8. **Add** _the spices_ and _3.5 cups black beans_.

---

## How to chop a vegetable

1. If the _vegetable_ is an onion, **peel back** the _papery skin_ and **cut off** the _top_.
2. **Cut** the _vegetable_ in _half_.
3. **Place** _each half_ cut-side down and **slice** the _vegetable_ _lengthwise_ in _parallel cuts_.
4. **Cut** the _vegetable_ with _several horizontal cuts parallel to the board_.
5. **Cut** through the _vegetable_ at _right angles to the board_.

- Each work in recipe vocabulary (chop, mince, saute, boil, etc) contains several sub-steps. These are _functions_!
- How you do each of these things is dependent on what you're doing it to (the _arguments_!)

---

You need to **declare** the function first.

```js
function sayHello (name) {
  return 'Hello, ' + name + '!'
}
```

Then you can **call** the function, which will actually run the code inside the curly braces.

```js
sayHello('Charlie')
// Hello, Charlie!
```

---

## Notes about functions

- Function declarations: a block of code that you define once and then can "invoke," or "call," over and over from other places in your code.
- _Declaring_ the function and _calling_ the function are two separate steps.
- Declare a function with the `function` keyword.
- The code inside the curly braces is executed when the function is called.
- To call a function, you need the name of the function and parentheses after it.
- Can optionally take _arguments_ (aka _parameters_), which are values you give to the function when you call it. When your function needs to receive some outside information to run, you need an argument. Can have multiple arguments. The position of the arguments matters.
- Functions can optionally return a value back. To return a value from the function, you need the `return` keyword.
- `return` also stops the function on that line and exits. Nothing in the body of the function after a `return` will be run.

---

## Creating and using functions

```js
function ordinal (num) {
  if ((num > 3 && num <= 20) || (num < -3 && num >= -20)) {
    return num + 'th'
  } else if (Math.abs(num % 10) === 1) {
    return num + 'st'
  } else if (Math.abs(num % 10) === 2) {
    return num + 'nd'
  } else if (Math.abs(num % 10) === 3) {
    return num + 'rd'
  }
  return num + 'th'
}
```

---

## Function arguments and variable names

- Function arguments are like variables
- You can reassign them with new values
- If you pass variables to a function as arguments, they _do not_ have to have the same name

---

## Using different variable and argument names example

```js
let ballRadius = 10
let pi = 3.14159

function circleArea (radius) {
  return pi * radius * radius
}

console.log(circleArea(ballRadius))
```

---

## Write some Javascript 3

Create a javascript file and link it to an html page (or use one the you created earlier). In the js file, write four functions as described below. You should be able to call these four functions in the console.

1. a function that takes a single argument and then logs that argument to the console.
2. a function called sum with two parameters that returns the sum of those 2 numbers.
3. a function called getLength that takes one argument (a string) and returns its length
4. a function that takes a character as an argument (i.e. a string of length 1) and returns true if it is a vowel, false otherwise.

---

## Scope

Variables have a _scope_ -- a defined area of the code where they exist and can be used. If you define a variable outside of any code block (an area surrounded by curly braces), it is available throughout your code. If you define a variable within a code block, it is available in that code block and all code blocks nested under it.

---

## Scope Example

```js
// global scope
let name = 'Keelan'
let score = 0

if (score === 0) {
  // new scope - name and score are available
  let punctuation = '!'
  printLoss(name, punctuation)
}

function printLoss (name, punctuation) {
  // new scope - name and punctuation are available from the arguments,
  // and score is available from the global scope
  let message = 'You lose, ' + name + punctuation
  console.log(message)
}
```
