# AJAX & the single-page app

AJAX: _Asynchronous JavaScript and XML_

A way of making requests programatically from your JavaScript instead of having the browser sent the request via a link or a url in the address bar.

This way, you can get and send data to a server without having to reload the page or go to a different page.

## URL anatomy

`http://www.google.com/maps/index.html?search=tacos&zip=27701`

- protocol
- subdomain, second-level-domain, top-level domain
- path
- query string parameters
  - `?` the start of the query string
  - `key=value` param pair
  - `&` (ampersand character) used to add additional query params
- URL encoding: only characters in the [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) char set
  - e.g. space represented as `%20`

# HTTP Request Methods

- `GET` Retrieve data (e.g., HTML or JSON)
- `POST`: Submit data for the first time
- `PATCH`, `PUT`: Update existing data, either all or in part
- `DELETE`: Delete existing data

# CRUD

Many web applications have a common core functionality we know by the charming acronym _CRUD_, which stands for the common actions most applications need to do:

_C_reate some data -> `POST`

_R_ead some data -> `GET`

_U_pdate some data -> `PATCH` or `PUT`

_D_elete some data -> `DELETE`

# Status Codes

An HTTP response message includes a status code that can indicate something about the state of the request. These are chosen by humans and aren't always exremely precise!

- `1xx`: Informational
- `2xx`: Success
- `3xx`: Redirection
- `4xx`: Client Error
- `5xx`: Server Error

`200` is the response we most often want, indicating a successful request.

# POST requests with Fetch

Notice that we pass a second argument to the `fetch` method, in addition to the url: an object containing options that supply additional details for the request.

```js
fetch(url, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
      username: 'pesopenguin',
      email: 'peso@octonauts.org'
    })
})
  .then(function (response) {
    return response.json()
  })
  .then(function (data) {
    console.log('You have been successfully subscribed', data)
  })

```
