# Form Validation

_Validation_ refers to the process of checking to make sure that data entered by a user is present and correct before it is used programmatically or stored somewhere.

We can validate data on the _client-side_ AND/OR on the _server-side_ (usually both).

If data is _invalid_, we want to know so that we can do something, like generate an error that alerts the user (or not do something! We wouldn't want to save faulty data to a database).
