# JavaScript Arrays

---

## Arrays

An array is a list of values. These values can be anything, including other arrays. They can be any length, including 0.

```js
let people = ['Sam', 'Zara', 'Autumn', 'Cadence', 'Gale']
let grades = [91, 83, 100, 87]
```

---

## Array indexes

An _index_ is a number that points to a position in an array. Indexes start at 0 and go to (length - 1), where length is the length of the array.

```js
let people = ['Sam', 'Zara', 'Autumn', 'Cadence', 'Gale']

people[0] // => "Sam"
people[1] // => "Zara"
people[4] // => "Gale"
people[people.length - 1] // => "Gale"
```

---

## Array properties and methods

Arrays have a `.length` property that gives us the length of the array.

They also have many methods to let us manipulate and interrogate them. You'll need to look them up as you get to know them!

[MDN JavaScript Reference: Arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)

---

## Looping through an array with `for`

We can use a `for` loop to get each index in an array and then use that index to get each member.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < people.length; i++) {
  console.log('Hello, ' + people[i] + '!')
}
```

---

## Using `while` to loop through an array

```js
let i = 0
while (i < people.length) {
  console.log(i, people[i])
  i += 1
}
```

---

## `for-of` loops

For a simpler way to loop over an array and get each member, we can use a `for-of` loop.

```js
for (let person of people) {
  console.log('Hello, ' + person + '!')
}
```

As the loop runs, each member of `people` is assigned to `person` in order. We _do not_ get the index in this case.

---

## Adding to and removing from the ends of arrays

```js
let students = ['Sam', 'Val', 'Landry']
students.push('Charlie')
students // => ["Sam", "Val", "Landry", "Charlie"]

students.pop() // => "Charlie"
students // => ["Sam", "Val", "Landry"]

students.unshift('Logan')
students // => ["Logan", "Sam", "Val", "Landry"]

students.shift() // => "Logan"
students // => ["Sam", "Val", "Landry"]
```

---

## Finding things in arrays

```js
let students = ['Sam', 'Val', 'Landry']

students.indexOf('Val') // => 1
students.indexOf('Landry') // => 2
students.indexOf('Logan') // => -1
```

---

## Removing things from arrays

```js
let students = ['Sam', 'Val', 'Landry']
let idx = students.indexOf('Val')
students.splice(idx, 1) // => ["Val"]
students // => ["Sam", "Landry"]
```

---

## Copying arrays

```js
students.slice() // returns a new array
```

There is also a newer syntax for copying arrays using the spread operator.

```js
let newArray = [...students]
```

---

## Common array actions

Three things we often want to do with arrays are:

- Transform an array (create a new array of the same length with derived values)
- Filter an array
- Get a single value from an array (sum, min, max, etc)

Let's see two techniques for each of these.

---

## Steps in transforming an array

1. Create a new array
2. Loop over the original array
3. For each element of the original array, transform it
4. Push the new transformed element into the new array

---

## Transforming an array, example 1

Get word lengths

```js
let words = ['tapeworm', 'gnarly', 'armoire']
let wordLengths = []

for (let word of words) {
  wordLengths.push(word.length)
}

// wordLengths => [8, 6, 7]
```

---

## Transforming an array, example 2

Is the score a passing grade?

```js
let scores = [91, 54, 78, 39, 81]
let passingGrades = []

for (let score of scores) {
  passingGrades.push(score >= 60)
}

// passingGrades => [true, false, true, false, true]
```

---

## Steps in filtering an array

1. Create a new array
2. Loop through the original array
3. For each element of the original array, test to see if you want to keep it
4. If you want to keep it, push the element into the new array

---

## Filtering an array, example 1

Get only words that have more than six letters.

```js
let words = ['tapeworm', 'gnarly', 'armoire']
let filteredWords = []

for (let word of words) {
  if (word.length > 6) {
    filteredWords.push(word)
  }
}

// filteredWords => ["tapeworm", "armoire"]
```

---

## Filtering an array, example 2

Keep only passing scores.

```js
let scores = [91, 54, 78, 39, 81]
let passingScores = []

for (let score of scores) {
  if (score >= 60) {
    passingScores.push(score)
  }
}

// passingScores => [91, 78, 81]
```

---

## Steps to getting one value from an array

### aka "reducing" an array

1. Find a starting value. This depends on the problem. If you want a sum, start with 0.
2. Loop over your array
3. For each element of the array, compare to the current value. If you need to update the value, do that.

This can be hard to follow!

---

## Reducing an array, example 1

Find the sum of all the numbers in the array.

```js
let scores = [91, 54, 78, 39, 81]
let sum = 0

for (let score of scores) {
  sum += score
}

// sum => 343
```

Here's the example we went over in class, logging each step so you can see what is happening:

```js
for (let score of scores){
console.log("sum is at: ", sum)
console.log("current score is: ", score)
sum += score // the value of sum changes here at this line!
console.log("Now that I've added the score to the sum I have ", sum)
}
```

---

## Reducing an array, example 2

Find the shortest word.

```js
let words = ['tapeworm', 'gnarly', 'armoire']
let shortestWord = null

for (let word of words) {
  if (shortestWord === null || word.length < shortestWord.length)
    shortestWord = word
}

// shortestWord = "gnarly"
```

---

## BUT WAIT!

## JavaScript has built-in Array methods that do all these common transformations

Transforming, filtering, and reducing all can be done with array methods.

- `.map()`
- `.filter()`
- `.reduce()`

## These methods take functions as arguments.

---

## Use a function as an argument

In JavaScript, functions are another type of value.

They can have names, via the `function` keyword:

```js

function greeting (name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}.`
}

```

...or saved to a variable with `let/const`:

```js
let greeting = function (name) {
return `Hello, ${name}.`
}

```
Notice that there is no name after the `function` keyword; the name of the function is the variable name.

Functions can also have no name. In this case we call them _anonymous_ functions.

---

## Anonymous functions

Use the `function` keyword, but leave the name out.

```js
function (score) {
  return score > 60
}
```

This is useful when we are using a function as an argument, which we do with `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.

---

## Transforming an array with `map`

Get word lengths.

```js
let words = ['tapeworm', 'gnarly', 'armoire']
let wordLengths = words.map(function (word) {
  return word.length
})
```

Note that `map` runs the loop for us! The function it takes as an argument (the _callback_ function) takes the individual elements one at a time as its argument (_`word`_).

`wordLengths` is the new array returned by `map`.

---

## Filtering an array with `filter`

```js
let words = ['tapeworm', 'gnarly', 'armoire']
let filteredWords = words.filter(function (word) {
  return word.length > 6
})

// filteredWords => ["tapeworm", "armoire"]
```

The filtering function should return true or false for each element.

You could think of this as the "keep" method. Elements which return `true` are kept.

---

## Reducing an array with `reduce`

```js
let scores = [91, 54, 78, 39, 81]
let sum = scores.reduce(function (total, score) {
  return total + score
}, 0)

// score => 343
```

---

## The reduce method, in detail

Note that `.reduce()` takes two arguments:

- a function that takes the current reduced value (also called the "accumulator") and the next array element as arguments
- the starting value (this is optional -- if you don't include it, the first array element is used as the accumulator, and the starting value will be the next item in the array)

Here is a demo that might help you visualize what is happening: [http://reduce.surge.sh/](http://reduce.surge.sh/)

---

## Reducing an array, example

```js
let words = ['tapeworm', 'gnarly', 'armoire']
let shortestWord = words.reduce(function (current, word) {
  if (word.length < current.length) {
    return word
  } else {
    return current
  }
})

// shortestWord = "gnarly"
```

We are not providing a starting value here, because we don't need to. It's simpler to use the first word as the value of "current" than to include 'null' as a starting value and then have to handle that case in our function.

---

## Arrow functions

For simple anonymous functions, the _arrow syntax_ is sometimes used. Curly braces are not needed and the return is implicit.

```js
function (score) {
  return score > 60
}

// vs
(score) => score > 60

// or even
score => score > 60
```

---

## Arrow function examples

```js
let words = ['tapeworm', 'gnarly', 'armoire']
let wordLengths = words.map(word => word.length)
let filteredWords = words.filter(word => word.length > 6)

let scores = [91, 54, 78, 39, 81]
let sum = scores.reduce((total, score) => total + score)
```
